üìã Project Overview This project is an Interactive Dashboard built using Microsoft Power BI to visualize and analyze the World Bank's ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) data. The goal of this project is to provide meaningful insights into countries' sustainability performance across 17 key ESG themes.

The dataset has been cleaned, transformed, and prepared in Microsoft Excel, and the final dashboard has been developed in Power BI to allow users to explore and compare ESG indicators at a country level.

üéØ Objectives Visualize and Compare ESG indicators across countries. Filter by ESG Categories: Enable users to explore data for Environment, Social, and Governance themes. Provide Context: Include tooltips and descriptions for each ESG indicator to improve understanding. Interactive Insights: Allow dynamic filtering by year, country, and ESG themes. üóÇÔ∏è Dataset Details The dataset comes from the World Bank‚Äôs ESG data draft, containing information on 17 key sustainability themes. Below are the key data tables used:

ecg_country: Contains country metadata such as region, income group, and 2-alpha codes. ecg_country-series: Maps ESG indicators (Series Codes) to countries. ecg_data: Contains ESG indicator values by year for each country. ecg_series: Provides details about each ESG indicator (e.g., definitions and units). ecg_footnote: Contains additional descriptive notes about the data.

Key Fields:

Country Code: Identifies countries (e.g., "USA" for the United States, "IND" for India).

Series Code: Represents ESG indicators (e.g., CO2 emissions, renewable energy usage).

Years: Contains time-series data for ESG performance.

Category: Classifies data into Environmental, Social, or Governance themes.

üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used

Microsoft Excel: Data cleaning, transformation, and preparation.

Power BI: Dashboard creation, visualization, and interactivity.

üìä Dashboard Features

Map Visualization
Location: Countries are plotted on a world map using their country codes. Color Coding: Countries are color-coded based on the selected ESG indicator (e.g., CO2 emissions). Filters: Users can filter by ESG categories (Environment, Social, Governance) and specific indicators.

Bar Chart
Comparison: Displays the selected ESG indicator values for multiple countries. Sorting: Users can sort the chart in ascending or descending order. Dynamic Updates: The chart updates based on the map selection or filter changes.

Line Chart
Trends: Shows ESG performance trends over time for selected countries or indicators. Yearly Insights: Highlights yearly changes for key indicators.

Card Visuals
Displays key metrics like Total ESG Score, Highest ESG Performer, or Average ESG Score.

Interactive Filters
Category Dropdown: Select Environment, Social, or Governance indicators. Year Selector: Filter data by specific years or ranges. Country Slicer: Focus on one or more countries for detailed analysis.

Tooltips
Hovering over map points or bar chart data shows additional details: Country Name ESG Value Series Description

üìñ Insights Derived

Global ESG Trends:

Certain regions show significant progress in renewable energy usage, while others lag behind. Top Performers:

High-income countries often lead in Governance and Social indicators, while Environmental scores vary significantly. Opportunities for Improvement:

Emerging markets show gaps in sustainability metrics but also present investment opportunities.

üóíÔ∏è Future Enhancements

Add more granular data for sub-national regions. Include predictions or forecasts using machine learning models. Enhance interactivity by integrating with Power BI Service for live updates.
